# Reddit Nudge Bot
The bot will nudge a user after detecting !Nudge [Username here] in a comment. It will then make a comment under the parent comment notifying the nudger that the user has been nudged and a private message will be sent to the nudged user with a link to the original comment along with the title [Nudger] nudged you. The bot will also detect !NudgeBot, leaving a message on how to use the bot as a comment under the parent comment.<br><br>Configure configs.py to build the bot!
