# Reddit Nudge Bot
The bot will nudge a user after detecting !Nudge [Username here] in a comment. It will then make a comment notifying the nudger that the user has been nudged and a private message will be sent to the nudged user with a link to the original comment.\Configure configs.py to build the bot!
